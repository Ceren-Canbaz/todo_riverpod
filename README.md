##  Hive 
My todo app stores tasks and other data securely using the hive package for local storage. It keeps the information safe and allows users to access it whenever they want.

##  Riverpod
Additionally, I use the riverpod package to manage the app's state. This means that any changes made within the app will automatically update all the different parts of the app. It ensures a consistent experience for the users.
